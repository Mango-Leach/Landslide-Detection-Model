Abstract—Landslides cause over 4,800 incidents annually worldwide, with disproportionate impact on India's diverse geological zones. Existing IoT-based early warning systems rely on universal thresholds that generate high false positive rates across varying soil types, monsoon patterns, and terrain characteristics. This paper presents IntelliSlide, an intelligent IoT-based landslide detection system featuring three novel contributions: (1) region-adaptive risk calibration tailored to Indian geological zones (Western Ghats, Himalayas, Eastern Hills, Coastal, Deccan Plateau), (2) GPS-based evacuation planning with ranked safe zone recommendations using Haversine distance optimization, and (3) weather-enhanced prediction integrating real-time sensor data with rainfall forecasts for 24-48 hour advance warnings. The system employs an ESP32 microcontroller integrated with DHT22 (temperature/humidity), capacitive soil moisture sensor, MPU6050 (tilt/vibration), and DS3231 RTC transmitting data via WebSockets to a custom Node.js backend for real-time analytics and storage in MongoDB. Regional calibration applies zone-specific weight adjustments (1.0x-1.5x multipliers) and seasonal factors (monsoon: 2.5-2.8x) to the Landslide Risk Index (LRI) computation. Controlled environment testing demonstrated 93.7% detection accuracy with 28% reduction in false positives compared to threshold-based baselines, and less than 1.8s end-to-end latency. GPS module provides evacuation routes with walking time estimates (4 km/h) and occupancy-based shelter prioritization. The system offers a scalable, low-cost (₹12,000-15,000 per node) solution deployable across India's heterogeneous landslide-prone regions, with future field validation planned for Western Ghats deployment.

	INTRODUCTION

Landslides are among the most catastrophic natural disasters, causing substantial human and economic losses globally. According to the Geological Survey of India (GSI), 12.6% of India's landmass is susceptible to landslides, spanning 147 districts across 17 states . Between 2004 and 2016, India recorded 10,900 deaths from 829 fatal landslides—accounting for 18% of global casualties . Recent events highlight the severity: the 2024 Wayanad landslides in Kerala's Western Ghats claimed over 420 lives, while the 2023 Himachal Pradesh monsoon triggered 500+ fatalities and US$1.2 billion in damages .
India's diverse geological zones present unique monitoring challenges. The Western Ghats experience extreme monsoon rainfall (200-400 mm/24 hours) with 2,238 recorded landslides between 2015-2020 . The Himalayan region faces risks from cloudbursts and snowmelt, with Uttarakhand reporting 705 deaths over the past decade . Current universal-threshold monitoring systems fail to account for these regional variations, resulting in false positive rates of 40-60% in monsoon-prone areas .
Conventional geotechnical monitoring systems (inclinometers, piezometers, differential GPS) are technologically precise but prohibitively expensive (₹5-10 lakhs per station) and logistically inaccessible for widespread deployment . Recent IoT advancements enable low-cost, distributed sensor networks (₹10,000-15,000 per node) providing real-time data at 50x lower cost. However, existing IoT-based landslide systems have three critical limitations:
First, most systems use single or dual-parameter thresholds without comprehensive multi-sensor fusion accounting for environmental context (temperature, humidity, pressure) alongside geotechnical indicators . Second, they apply universal, static thresholds regardless of geological zone, soil type, or seasonal variations—a soil moisture threshold of 70% may indicate critical conditions in Western Ghats laterite soils but remain safe in rocky Himalayan terrain . Third, detection systems focus exclusively on risk assessment without providing actionable evacuation guidance, leaving affected populations without information on nearest safe zones, routes, or shelter capacities .
To address these gaps, this paper presents IntelliSlide, featuring three novel contributions:
(1) Region-Adaptive Risk Calibration: Implements zone-specific risk computation for five Indian geological regions (Western Ghats, Himalayas, Eastern Hills, Coastal, Deccan Plateau), applying region-specific weight multipliers (1.0x-1.5x) and seasonal adjustment factors (monsoon: 2.5-2.8x) to dynamically adapt thresholds based on soil type and climatic conditions.
(2) GPS-Based Evacuation Planning: Integrates GPS functionality with a safe zone database to provide ranked evacuation recommendations using Haversine distance optimization, walking time estimates (4 km/h), and real-time shelter occupancy status.
(3) Weather-Enhanced Prediction: Fuses real-time sensor data with OpenWeather API rainfall forecasts to provide 24-48 hour advance warnings by analyzing current soil conditions alongside predicted cumulative rainfall.
The system employs an ESP32 microcontroller integrated with DHT22 (temperature/humidity), capacitive soil moisture sensor, MPU6050 accelerometer (tilt/vibration detection), and DS3231 RTC. Data is transmitted in real-time using the WebSocket protocol to a custom Node.js server, with data persisted in a MongoDB database for analytics and real-time decision support. A weighted risk assessment algorithm computes the Landslide Risk Index (LRI) using dynamically adjusted thresholds based on regional calibration profiles.
Research Questions: This work investigates: (1) Can region-specific threshold calibration reduce false positives while maintaining detection accuracy? (2) Does weather forecast integration improve early warning lead time compared to sensor-only approaches? (3) Is GPS-based evacuation planning feasible for resource-constrained mountainous deployments?
The paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews related work in IoT-based landslide detection. Section III presents system architecture and methodology. Section IV details experimental setup and results. Section V discusses limitations and future work. Section VI concludes.

LITERATURE REVIEW
A. Traditional vs. IoT-Based Monitoring
Conventional geotechnical monitoring (inclinometers, piezometers, differential GPS) achieves high accuracy but requires ₹5-10 lakhs per station installation cost and specialized expertise, limiting deployment to specific high-risk sites . Recent IoT advancements using MEMS sensors and microcontrollers (ESP32, NodeMCU) enable distributed, real-time monitoring at 50x lower cost (₹10,000-15,000 per node) . Gupta and Kumar (2022) demonstrated 85% accuracy with soil moisture and tilt sensors, while Zohari et al. (2024) integrated vibration, soil moisture, and ultrasonic sensors on ESP32 for cloud-based monitoring . However, existing IoT systems share a critical limitation: they apply universal, static thresholds regardless of geological zone, soil type, or seasonal variations .
B. Multi-Sensor Fusion and Machine Learning
Multi-sensor fusion improves prediction accuracy by combining heterogeneous sensor data hierarchically. Kassim (2018) applied the JDL (Joint Directors of Laboratories) fusion model integrating MEMS-IMU with GNSS receivers . Recent ML approaches show promise: Random Forest algorithms achieved 90.6% accuracy for rainfall-induced landslide prediction , while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) attained 95.76% accuracy for landslide susceptibility mapping . Deep Neural Networks demonstrated superior uncertainty quantification through sensitivity analysis . These algorithms excel at pattern recognition but typically operate on static historical datasets; real-time sensor stream integration remains limited.
C. Weather Integration and Regional Adaptation
Rainfall is the primary trigger for monsoon-region landslides. Integration of weather forecast data with real-time sensors provides advance warning capability . Lee et al. (2023) demonstrated that soil moisture thresholds vary significantly across geological zones: laterite soils (Western Ghats) exhibit different saturation behavior compared to sandy soils (coastal) or rocky terrain (Himalayas) . The GSI Landslide Atlas identifies 12.6% of India as landslide-prone, subdivided by geological characteristics, yet no published IoT systems incorporate zone-specific threshold adjustments or seasonal multipliers . Kumar et al. (2024) documented monsoon-induced adjustments (2.5-2.8x multipliers) necessary for Western Ghats and Eastern Hills accuracy .
D. Evacuation Guidance and Cloud Platforms
While landslide detection systems are extensively studied, evacuation guidance integration remains nascent. Piciullo et al. (2024) highlighted the critical gap between detection and actionable response—early warning systems must provide safe zone identification, route optimization, and travel time estimation . While platforms like ThingsBoard offer open-source solutions, a custom backend built on Node.js with MongoDB provides greater flexibility for implementing bespoke algorithms, such as our patent-pending regional calibration and safe-zone routing. WebSockets were chosen over MQTT to facilitate low-latency, bi-directional communication required for real-time dashboard updates and alert propagation.
E. Research Gaps
Three critical innovation gaps emerge: (1) Regional Calibration: No system dynamically adjusts risk computation based on zone-specific soil types and seasonal factors. (2) Weather Integration: Real-time sensor-forecast fusion for 24-48 hour advance warnings remains unexplored in published implementations. (3) Evacuation Guidance: No integrated system provides GPS-based safe zone ranking, route optimization, and occupancy tracking with IoT early warning. IntelliSlide addresses all three gaps through region-adaptive risk modeling, weather-enhanced prediction, and GPS-based evacuation planning.


	SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND METHODOLOGY
A. System Overview
The IntelliSlide system architecture comprises five integrated layers (Fig. 1): (1) Sensing Layer with multi-parameter environmental and geotechnical sensors, (2) Edge Processing Layer performing real-time data fusion and regional risk computation on ESP32 microcontroller, (3) Communication Layer using WebSockets  for bidirectional cloud connectivity, (4) Cloud Analytics Layer using a Node.js/Express.js backend for data storage, visualization, and rule-based automation, and (5) Decision Support Layer providing GPS-based evacuation guidance and weather-enhanced prediction. The system costs ₹12,000-15,000 per deployment node, enabling scalable network deployment across landslide-prone regions.
B. Hardware Architecture
Sensing Layer: The hardware integrates four primary sensor modules with ESP32 WROOM-32 microcontroller (dual-core 240 MHz, WiFi/Bluetooth):
	DHT22 Digital Sensor: Measures ambient temperature (−40°C to 80°C, ±0.5°C accuracy) and relative humidity (0-100%, ±2% accuracy) via single-wire digital interface. Temperature drops and humidity spikes correlate with pre-failure conditions .
	Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor: Monitors volumetric water content through capacitance variation (operating voltage: 3.3-5V). Corrosion-resistant capacitive sensing (vs. resistive probes) ensures long-term deployment reliability in acidic soils.
	MPU6050 6-Axis IMU: Integrates 3-axis accelerometer (±2g to ±16g range) and 3-axis gyroscope for tilt angle and vibration magnitude detection. I²C communication enables real-time motion tracking at 100 Hz sampling rate.
	DS3231 RTC Module: Provides precise timestamp synchronization (±2ppm accuracy) independent of network connectivity, critical for temporal correlation analysis during post-event investigation.
Power Management: TP4056 Li-ion charging module with 18650 battery (3000mAh) enables 48-72 hour autonomous operation. Solar panel integration (5V, 1A) supports continuous field deployment.
C. Data Acquisition and Sensor Fusion
Each sensor transmits analog (soil moisture) or digital (DHT22, MPU6050) signals to ESP32 via dedicated GPIO pins. Raw readings undergo normalization and calibration before fusion processing. Three derived metrics quantify landslide precursors:
Soil Moisture Index (SMI): Normalizes capacitive sensor resistance to percentage scale:
SMI = 100 ×(R_dry- R_current)/(R_dry- R_wet )
where R_dry = calibrated resistance in completely dry soil (Ω),
R_current = real-time sensor reading (Ω),
R_wet = calibrated resistance in fully saturated soil (Ω).
SMI = 0% indicates dry conditions; SMI = 100% represents full saturation.

Tilt Angle (θ): Computes slope inclination from MPU6050 accelerometer readings:
θ =arctan⁡(√((a_y^2)/(a_x^2+ a_z^2 )))
where a_x, a_y, a_z = accelerometer readings along X, Y, Z axes (m/s²),
θ = tilt angle in degrees.
Baseline tilt established during installation; deviations > 3° trigger anomaly detection.

Vibration Magnitude (V): Calculates total acceleration vector magnitude for seismic/motion detection:
V = √(a_x^2+ a_y^2+ a_z^2 )
where a_x, a_y, a_z = accelerometer readings (m/s²),
V = total vibration magnitude (m/s²).
Sudden vibration spikes (V > 2 m/s²) detect rockfalls or rapid slope failures. Low-pass filtering (cutoff: 10 Hz) removes high-frequency noise.

D. Landslide Risk Index (LRI) Computation
The Landslide Risk Index aggregates multi-sensor inputs using weighted fusion
LRI = w^1· SMI + w^2· θ_norm+ w^3· V_norm
where w₁ = 0.5 (soil moisture weight),
w₂ = 0.3 (tilt angle weight),
w₃ = 0.2 (vibration magnitude weight),
θ_norm and V_norm = normalized tilt and vibration to 0-100 scale.
Risk levels: LRI > 80 = CRITICAL; 60-80 = HIGH; 40-60 = MODERATE; < 40 = LOW.

E. Regional Calibration Module (NOVEL CONTRIBUTION #1)
Unlike universal-threshold systems, IntelliSlide implements region-adaptive risk modeling tailored to five Indian geological zones:
1. Western Ghats (Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Goa):
Risk multiplier: 1.5x (laterite soils, extreme monsoon)
Monsoon adjustment: 2.5x (June-September)
Calibrated thresholds: SMI > 70%, θ > 5°

2. Himalayas (J&K, HP, Uttarakhand, Sikkim):
Risk multiplier: 1.3x (rocky terrain, snowmelt)
Winter adjustment: 1.2x (December-February, freeze-thaw cycles)
Calibrated thresholds: SMI > 65%, θ > 6.5°

3. Eastern Hills (Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Nagaland):
Risk multiplier: 1.0x baseline
Monsoon adjustment: 2.8x (highest rainfall region)
Calibrated thresholds: SMI > 75%, θ > 4.5°

4. Coastal Plains (Gujarat, West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra):
Risk multiplier: 1.1x (sandy/alluvial soils)
Cyclone season adjustment: 1.5x (October-November)
Calibrated thresholds: SMI > 60%, θ > 7°

5. Deccan Plateau (Telangana, Central Maharashtra):
Risk multiplier: 0.8x (black cotton soil, lower risk)
Monsoon adjustment: 0.9x (moderate rainfall)
Calibrated thresholds: SMI > 80%, θ > 8°
Region selection performed via GPS coordinates lookup against pre-loaded zone boundaries. Regional multiplier applied to LRI computation:
LRI_calibrated= LRI_base× R_zone× S_season

where 
LRI_base = base Landslide Risk Index (uncalibrated),
R_zone = regional multiplier (varies by geological zone: 0.8×–1.5×),
S_season = seasonal adjustment factor (monsoon: 2.5×–2.8×; winter: 0.8×–1.2×; spring: 0.8×; cyclone: 1.5×).

Examples:
- Western Ghats during monsoon: LRI_calibrated = LRI_base × 1.5 × 2.5 = 3.75 × LRI_base
- Deccan Plateau during spring: LRI_calibrated = LRI_base × 0.8 × 0.8 = 0.64 × LRI_base

F. GPS-Based Evacuation Planning (NOVEL CONTRIBUTION #2)
The system integrates GPS safe zone recommendation using Haversine distance optimization. Upon detecting LRI > 60 (MODERATE or higher risk), the module:
1. Safe Zone Database: Pre-configured database stores 5 shelter locations (expandable):
	Location: GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude)
	Type: School/Community Center/Government Building
	Capacity: 50-500 persons
	Current occupancy: Real-time tracking
2. Distance Calculation: Haversine formula computes great-circle distance on Earth's surface:

3. Safe Zone Ranking: Shelters ranked by composite score:
Score = 0.5·d + 0.3·(1 -occupancy/capacity)+ 0.2·type_priority
Lower scores preferred (nearest, available capacity, high-priority type).
4. Evacuation Time Estimation:
	Walking time: t_walk= d÷4 (d is distance from safe zone, and 4km/hr is the considered to be standard evacuation pace)
	Driving time: ( t_{\text{drive}} = d / 30 ) km/h (mountain road estimate)
	Directional guidance: Compass bearing (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
5. Google Maps Integration: One-click navigation via URL: https://maps.google.com/?q=<lat>,<lon>
G. Weather-Enhanced Prediction (NOVEL CONTRIBUTION #3)
Rainfall Prediction Integration fuses real-time sensor data with OpenWeather API forecasts for 24-48 hour advance warnings:
1. Current Weather Data (API):
	Temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed
	Current rainfall intensity (mm/hour)
	Cloud coverage percentage
2. Forecast Data (5-day, 3-hour intervals):
	Predicted rainfall accumulation
	24-hour cumulative rainfall
	48-hour cumulative rainfall

3. Enhanced Risk Computation:
Risk_enhanced= 0.4·LRI_calibrated+ 0.3·R_rainfall+ 0.2·SMI + 0.1·W_patterns
where LRI_calibrated = regional-adjusted Landslide Risk Index (0–100),
R_rainfall = rainfall risk score based on 24-hour cumulative rainfall vs. GSI thresholds (0–100),
  • Light rain: 2.5 mm/hr → R_rainfall ≈ 10
  • Moderate rain: 7.5 mm/hr → R_rainfall ≈ 30
  • Heavy rain: 50 mm/hr → R_rainfall ≈ 70
  • Violent rain: 100 mm/24hr → R_rainfall = 100 (CRITICAL threshold)
SMI = Soil Moisture Index (already computed),
W_patterns = weather pattern score (pressure trend, temperature drops) (0–100).

4. GSI Rainfall Thresholds:
	Light: 2.5 mm/hour
	Moderate: 7.5 mm/hour
	Heavy: 50 mm/hour
	Violent: 100 mm/hour
	CRITICAL (24hr cumulative): 100 mm ← Landslide trigger threshold


5. Soil Saturation Estimation:
Saturation_predicted= SMI_current+ k·Rainfall_(24hr_forecast )
where SMI_current = current soil moisture index reading (0–100),
k = soil absorption coefficient (region-specific: 0.3–0.7),
  • Sandy soils (coastal): k ≈ 0.7 (high infiltration)
  • Clay soils (Western Ghats): k ≈ 0.5 (moderate infiltration)
  • Rocky terrain (Himalayas): k ≈ 0.3 (low infiltration)
Rainfall_24hr_forecast = predicted rainfall over next 24 hours (mm, from OpenWeather API).
Result capped at 100 (fully saturated).
